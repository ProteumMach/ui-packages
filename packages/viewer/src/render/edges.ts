/**
 * The lines between regions, and nothing else.
 *
 * `EdgesGeometry` draws an edge wherever two facets meet at more than some
 * angle, which is a guess standing in for "is this a real edge". On a machined
 * part the guess is wrong in both directions: a small bore tessellated into
 * twelve facets has 30° between them and gets drawn as a nut, while a shallow
 * chamfer meeting a wall at 12° gets no line at all.
 *
 * The report already knows. A region is one analytic surface, so an edge inside
 * one is tessellation and an edge between two is a real boundary — the same
 * fact that makes region-aware shading possible, used for the other half of
 * what makes a part read as a part.
 *
 * With one qualification. The Engine splits a surface where that makes a better
 * machining plan, and those splits are boundaries between regions without being
 * edges of the part: a floor cut in two to be reached from two directions is
 * still one flat floor. So the walk is over *visual surfaces* — regions grouped
 * where they continue each other — and a split leaves no line. See
 * `visualSurfaces`; nothing about picking or features goes through it.
 *
 * The mesh must be non-indexed, which `parsePartGeometry` guarantees.
