/**
 * Feature types from most specific to least, for resolving a viewport click.
 *
 * Nothing geometric can separate a region's owners — two `wall` features on the
 * same physical face from different directions reference an *identical* region
 * set, so they have identical area by construction. Specificity is the only
 * ordering left, and it is a judgement about intent: a hole is what someone
 * means when they click a hole's wall.
 *
 * `profile` ranks last, alone. It is a boundary contour rather than a machined
 * surface, so it should never win a click against the surface it traces — and
 * because every direction's profile overlaps most of that direction's regions,
 * this one rule resolves every in-direction collision on the cube.
