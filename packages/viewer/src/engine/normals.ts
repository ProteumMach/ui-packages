/**
 * Shades each region smoothly and every boundary between them hard.
 *
 * The Engine's mesh carries positions and nothing else, so the normals have to
 * be invented. Averaging them across the whole mesh smooth-shades a cube —
 * every corner reads as a ball bearing. Not averaging at all gives every
 * triangle its own normal, which is honest but leaves a bore looking like a
 * fifty-sided nut, because that is exactly what its triangles are.
 *
 * Neither is necessary here, because the report says which triangles belong to
 * one analytic surface. Averaging *within* a region and never *across* one
 * gives a bore that shades like a bore and an edge that stays an edge: the
 * distinction a mesh cannot express is one the region table can.
 *
 * Two vertices are the same point if their coordinates match exactly. That is
 * safe rather than optimistic — `toNonIndexed` copies each shared vertex from
 * one source value, so the duplicates it makes are bit-identical, which is the
 * only case this needs to find.
 *
 * The geometry must be non-indexed, which `parsePartGeometry` guarantees.
