/**
 * Parses a mesh into the geometry the renderer and the region index share.
 *
 * Three things happen here, and each one is load-bearing:
 *
 * - **De-index, always.** The Engine writes an indexed GLB with shared vertices
 *   (the cube: 8 vertices, 36 indices). The region highlight is a *per-vertex*
 *   attribute, and a shared corner vertex belongs to three regions at once, so
 *   there is no value to write into it. Non-indexed is not an optimization
 *   here, it is what makes region attributes expressible.
 * - **Compute normals, if the mesh ships none.** The GLB currently ships
 *   `POSITION` only. Doing this *after* de-indexing is what gives faceted CAD
 *   shading; the other order smooth-shades a cube, which reads as a rendering
 *   bug rather than the data-handling one it is.
 * - **Check the counts.** The report's region ranges index this triangle
 *   buffer. If the two disagree about how many triangles there are, they are
 *   not the same artifact and nothing downstream can be trusted.
 *
 * Coordinates are passed through untouched: the Engine emits millimetres, Z-up,
 * usually with a corner at the origin, and `GLTFLoader` does not rotate a scene
 * to the glTF Y-up convention. Centring and framing are the camera's business,
 * not the loader's — region geometry is quoted in part space, so part space is
 * what gets rendered.
 *
 * `toNonIndexed()` renumbers nothing at the triangle level: it walks the index
 * buffer in order, three vertices at a time, so triangle `i` stays triangle
 * `i`. That is what makes it safe to apply before region ranges, and it is
 * asserted against the real cube in `geometry.test.ts` because it looks
 * dangerous and is not.
